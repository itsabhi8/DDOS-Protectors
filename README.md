# DDOS-Protectors
DDoS Protection Using Machine Learning

Objective:
Develop a machine learning-based solution to detect and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The project aims to enhance network security by accurately identifying malicious traffic and minimizing disruptions caused by such attacks.

Datasets:

Imbalanced Dataset: Contains predominantly normal traffic with limited attack instances, reflecting real-world traffic distributions.
Balanced Dataset: Features an equal distribution of normal and attack traffic to facilitate unbiased model training and evaluation.
Approach:
Utilize machine learning algorithms to classify network traffic as either benign or malicious. Techniques include supervised learning (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests), ensemble methods, and anomaly detection to handle traffic effectively and respond to attacks in real-time.

Goals:

Improve detection accuracy for both normal and attack traffic.
Address challenges related to dataset imbalance.
Enhance real-time response capabilities to mitigate DDoS attacks.
Outcome:
The project aims to deliver a robust model that improves network security by accurately detecting and responding to DDoS threats, leveraging insights from both imbalanced and balanced data scenarios.
